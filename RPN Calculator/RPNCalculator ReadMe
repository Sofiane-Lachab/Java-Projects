COMMENTS: This assignment took me approximately 6 hours to complete. The hardest part was figuring out the actual data types and how
to properly utilize the stack data type to make a calculator. After that, it was mostly simple, but time consuming. I finished the program
and had a working calculator, but I spent a lot of time rewriting the code to fix spacing issues on Submitty. That is the main reason this is
being turned in so late, as other than that, the program was finished about a week ago.
